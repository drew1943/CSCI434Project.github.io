    <h2>Basic Steps</h2>

    <div class="photocard">
        <img src="RubikSolveSteps.png" alt="Rubik's Cube overview steps">
        <p>This is the basic overview of all steps to solve a Rubik's Cube.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>1. Solve the White Cross</h3>
        <p>Goal: make a cross on one face (conventionally white) and make sure the side colors of those edge pieces match the center colors on the adjacent faces.
        How to do it: Find a white edge piece (white plus a side color). Bring it to the top layer and rotate the top until the side color lines up with its center, then turn that edge down into the bottom face.
        Most of the time this is done with intuitive turns; there is no single required algorithm. Practice getting the edges to match both center colors (not only the white).</p>
        <img src="WhiteCross.png" alt="Rubik's Cube white cross example">
        <p>Form a white cross that aligns with the center colors on all sides.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>2. Solve the White Corners</h3>
        <p>Goal: Put each corner that belongs with the white face into place so the entire first face is solved and the side stickers match their centers.
        Algorithm (corner insertion / rotation): repeatedly use this to rotate a corner in place until the white sticker is on the bottom (assuming you hold the solved white cross on bottom):
        R' D' R D
        How to use it: Place the unsolved white corner in the bottom-front-right position (so the white sticker is on the side or top, not already on bottom).
        Apply R' D' R D repeatedly until the corner is oriented correctly (white on the bottom). Repeat for all four corners</p>
        <img src="WhiteLayer.png" alt="Rubik's Cube white corners example">
        <p>Insert each white corner until the whole white face is complete.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>3. Solve the Middle Layer</h3>
        <p>Goal: Move the four non-top-color edges from the top layer into the middle layer without disturbing the solved first layer.
        You will use two mirror algorithms depending on whether the required edge slot is to the right or left of the front face.
        To insert an edge that needs to go to the right (from top → right slot): U R U' R' U' F' U F
        To insert an edge that needs to go to the left (from top → left slot): U' L' U L U F U' F'
        How to use: Hold the cube so the front face shows the edge you want to insert on top, and the edge’s side color lines up with the front center.
        Decide if the piece must go to the left or right slot, then perform the matching algorithm.
        Repeat until the middle layer edges are all placed.</p>
        <img src="MiddleEdge.png" alt="Rubik's Cube middle layer example">
        <p>Use left and right algorithms to place the middle layer edges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>4. Solve the Yellow Layer</h3>
        <p>Goal: Make a cross on the top face (usually the yellow face) regardless of edge permutation.
        Look at the top face: you will see one of three useful patterns: Dot (no top edge yellow)
        L shape (like a small corner L)
        Line (a straight bar)
        Use this single algorithm until you reach the cross:
        F R U R' U' F'
        Notes: If you have the dot, do the algorithm once holding any orientation.
        If you have the L shape, rotate so the L is at upper left, then do the algorithm.
        If you have the line, rotate so the line is horizontal, then do the algorithm.
        After applying it as needed, the top will show a cross.</p>

        <p>Create the yellow cross by repeating the algorithm and rotating the cube.</p>

        <p>Rotate the corners to complete the yellow face.</p>

        <h2>Final Tips</h2>
        <p>The more you practice the steps, the faster you will become at recognizing patterns and moving smoothly through the solution. Beginners often take ten to fifteen minutes per solve, and that time improves naturally with repetition.</p>
        <p>Please take a look at the link page for some helpful sites if you are courious about speed solving or other twisty puzzles.</p>
        <p>Short algorithm summary (cheat sheet) 
            <br>Corner twist / insert (first layer corners): R' D' R D 
            <br>Edge insert to right (middle layer): U R U' R' U' F' U F 
            <br>Edge insert to left (middle layer): U' L' U L U F U' F' 
            <br>Make top cross: F R U R' U' F' 
            <br>Orient top corners (repeat pattern): R U R' U R U2 R' 
            <br>Permute corners (3-cycle): U R U' L' U R' U' L 
            <br>Common final edge cycle (beginner style): R U R' U R U2 R' U 
            <br>(Practice each until you can do it without looking.)</p>
